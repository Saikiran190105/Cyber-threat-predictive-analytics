# 🔐 Cyber Threat Predictive Analytics

A Machine Learning-based project focused on predictive analytics for cyber supply chain security. The system helps in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential cyber threats before they can impact operations.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to leverage advanced data analytics and ML techniques to predict potential cyber threats in digital supply chains. It collects and processes data from various cyber indicators and applies trained models to classify and predict possible threats, enabling proactive defense mechanisms.

## 🧠 Features

- Data collection and preprocessing from cyber threat databases
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering and selection
- Implementation of classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
- Evaluation using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization of model performance using confusion matrix and ROC curves

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Modeling:** ML classification models (SVM, RF, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saikiran190105/Cyber-threat-predictive-analytics.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory and open the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
cd Cyber-threat-predictive-analytics
cd cyber-threat
```

3. Run :
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
   

## 📊 Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test data (update with your actual result). Performance was validated through:
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Curve
- Classification Report

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time data streams for threat detection
- Build a web dashboard for threat monitoring
- Implement deep learning models for better precision
